<p>The poem here reprinted has remained unread and, with a single
exception, apparently unnoticed from the day it was published until the
present. It is printed from a copy which I acquired many years ago at a
London bookstore and which for a while I thought unique. I&nbsp;did not
find it listed in the catalogues of the chief libraries of England or
America, nor in the various books on anonymous publications. I&nbsp;have
found no mention of it in the newspapers and magazines of the time, no
mention of it in contemporary letters or diaries. The one man in England
who took the trouble to record the ode for posterity was, as might be
expected, Horace Walpole, who in his manuscript Books of Materials
merely noted that the poem had been published in 176<i>8</i>
(<i>Anecdotes of Painting ... Volume the Fifth</i>, ed. Hilles and
Daghlian, Yale University Press, 1937). When challenged to locate
Walpole’s copy of the ode, the greatest of modern collectors was able,
after perhaps forty-five seconds, to say not only that it was in the
Houghton Library at Harvard but that on the title in Walpole’s hand was
the information that the poem was published on the sixteenth of May,
a&nbsp;fact which would otherwise be unknown. A&nbsp;third copy was in
the possession of the late Professor Heidbrink of Northwestern,
inscribed in a contemporary hand “T.&nbsp;M., M.A.” and thus, possibly,
the author’s own. There are, then, three known copies extant. Doubtless
others will be found, bound up with pamphlets of the same vintage, as
yet uncatalogued.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<p>What Walpole did not know was the name of the author, and quite
possibly the ode would have remained unread and unnoticed for another
two centuries had Mr. Kirkwood not brought to light the letters which
are first published in the introduction that follows. From these letters
and a few known facts the history of the ode seems clear enough.
Reynolds had a number of relatives living in Great Torrington. In the
summer of 1762 when he and Dr. Johnson went to Devonshire they were
entertained by Morrison. Johnson’s published letters prove that he did
not forget Morrison, and Reynolds was soon painting the portrait of
Morrison’s daughter. In the summer of 1766 Morrison sent his ode to
Reynolds. The following January he learned that Johnson, “as severe a
Critic as old Dennis,” praised it and ordered it to be published.
Reynolds himself must have arranged for the publication.</p>

<p>The publisher selected was William Griffin, who a few years later was
to bring out some of Sir Joshua’s <i>Discourses</i>. The work of the
printer was only moderately well done. It will be noted that
<i>whose</i> (second line of stanza&nbsp;V) is obviously a misprint for
<i>whole</i>, that the second line has dropped out of stanza XXXIV (Mr.
Kirkwood ingeniously suggests that Morrison wrote: “for every trifler’s
breast/Is by the hope of future fame possest”), and that in two places
the number of a stanza has been omitted. And yet the ode, which is
physically thinner as well as historically and aesthetically inferior to
Gray’s famous odes, is priced at 1/6, whereas the Strawberry Hill
edition of Gray’s <i>Odes</i> (1757) sold for but a shilling.</p>

<p>Clearly Morrison was not influenced by, if familiar with, <i>The
Progress of Poesy</i> and <i>The Bard</i>. His ode is Pindaric in the
late seventeenth-century sense. In his brief preface he explains that he
has sought to please us
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
“with a little variety of wild music,” believing “that the perpetual
recurrence of the same measure in such a multiplicity of stanzas would
have been rather languid and fatiguing.” An examination of the poem
shows that Morrison has carried his desire for variety to the extreme.
The poem consists of thirty-five stanzas, not one of which repeats both
the metrical pattern and rhyme scheme of any other. The stanzas range
from six to eighteen lines in length, and the lines themselves from four
short syllables to the long Alexandrine. At times one has the feeling
that this love of changing rhythms and rhymes has improperly warped the
meaning of a given passage.</p>

<p>The author shows his familiarity with the standard books on
aesthetics. In <i>Idler</i> No. 76, published in 1759, Reynolds laughed
at those who by mastering a few phrases posed as connoisseurs. He
introduced a gentleman who had just returned from Italy, “his mouth full
of nothing but the grace of <i>Raffaelle</i>,... and the sublimity and
grand contorno of <i>Michael Angelo</i>.” This gentleman criticised a
Vandyck because it “had not the flowing line,” and of “St. Paul
preaching” said, “what an addition to that nobleness could
<i>Raffaelle</i> have given, had the art of contrast been known in his
time! but above all, the flowing line.” Morrison is familiar with the
jargon, as is seen throughout the ode. At the beginning he displays wit
in applying these phrases not to painting but to his verse:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>With my easy flowing line</p>
<p>To unite correctness of design.</p>
</div>

<p>And at the end he rather neatly twists the famous statement of
Appelles into a justification for his writing a poem to add to the
reputation of a great painter.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<p>The ode falls into two roughly equal parts. In the first half the
poet describes specific examples of what he calls History and Landskip.
The battle painting sounds like something by Il Borgognone, the
crucifixion perhaps by Guido Reni. The other painters are
named--Vanderveld and, inevitably, Claude. The late Miss Manwaring would
not have been surprised to learn that more space is devoted to Claude
than to the others. Then almost precisely at the half-way point a
pleasing trance is interrupted by the portrait of a “hoary sage,”
perhaps, Mr. Kirkwood suggests, the portrait Reynolds had recently
completed of the Rev. Zachariah Mudge, then seventy-two years of age,
who had been since 1737 a fellow prebendary of Morrison’s at Exeter, and
whom Reynolds described as “the wisest man he had ever met.” From this
point on the poet addresses Reynolds and incidentally describes with
skill two of his most popular portraits, “Lady Sarah Bunbury sacrificing
to the Graces” (exhibited in 1765) and “Garrick between Tragedy and
Comedy” (exhibited in 1762). Garrick was then at the height of his fame,
and this was the most notable of the many portraits painted of him. Lady
Sarah, “the bright Lenox” of stanza XXIII, was equally celebrated in her
sphere. Among the bridesmaids at the wedding of George III she was, in
Walpole’s opinion, the “chief angel.” “With neither features nor air,
nothing ever looked so charming as Lady Sarah Lenox; she has all the
glow of beauty peculiar to her family.” She was the great granddaughter
of Charles II; hence Morrison’s <i>regal</i>. And in the poem as in the
painting she is feeding the flame which does honor to the Graces.</p>

<p>Johnson’s hostility to “our Pindarick madness” is well known. The
“first and obvious defect” of Dryden’s <i>Threnodia</i> “is the
irregularity of its metre.” The “lax and lawless versification” of this
type of
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
poetry, he wrote in the <i>Life of Cowley</i>, “concealed the
deficiencies of the barren, and flattered the laziness of the idle.” One
cannot but wonder therefore at his praise of Morrison’s ode. To be sure,
Reynolds quotes Johnson as pronouncing it “superior to any Poem <i>of
the kind</i> that has been publish’d these many years,” and Johnson may
well have considered praise of this sort as he did lapidary
inscriptions. It may be worth noting, however, that none of his recorded
comments on Pindaric verse antedate the publication of this ode.
Conceivably he himself was unaware of his hostility until, more than ten
years later, he was forced to criticise the poets who made the English
Pindaric popular.</p>

<p>Perhaps too by ordering its publication he was saying indirectly what
he had already expressed in many of his writings, for example in
<i>Rambler</i> No. 23: “the publick, which is never corrupted, nor often
deceived, is to pass the last sentence upon literary claims.” If this is
so, a&nbsp;series like the Augustan Reprints necessarily deals with
literary failures. And yet Morrison’s ode is well worth reading today as
a pleasing example of what I somewhat fearsomely term the baroque, of
what the cultured gentleman of that time regarded as a token of good
taste. Long dormant, it is here given new life. Who knows but that the
prophecy made by Morrison at the end of the poem may after all be
fulfilled:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "indent">In the long course of rolling years,</p>
<p class = "indent">When all thy labour disappears,</p>
<p>Yet shall this verse descend from age to age,</p>
<p class = "indent">And, breaking from oblivion’s shade,</p>
<p>Go on, to flourish while thy paintings fade.</p>

<h5><a name = "postscript" id = "postscript">Postscript</a></h5>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood has sent me information, too late to be incorporated in
the preface, which adds to, and in an important way corrects, what I
have written.</p>

<p>In the Print Room of the British Museum there is an engraving by
James Watson “From an Original Picture by Vandevelde, in the Possession
of Mr. Reynolds.” Every detail in the engraving tallies with Morrison’s
word-painting of the Vandevelde. Furthermore the description of a
landscape by Claude (a&nbsp;View near Castle Gondolfo) in the sale of
Sir Joshua’s collection of paintings in 1795 suggests that this was the
Claude Morrison had in mind when writing his ode. In other words, it is
probable that all the paintings discussed in the poem had been seen by
Morrison in Reynolds’s house.</p>

<p>As to matters of fact, the ode, it turns out, was not unnoticed in
its day. It was commented upon in both the <i>Critical</i> and the
<i>Monthly</i>--not in 1767 but in 1768. The reviewer in the
<i>Critical</i> (vol. 25, p.&nbsp;393, in the monthly catalogue for May)
wrote: <ins class = "correction" title = "“ missing">This</ins> is an
elegant and ingenious descriptive poem. The author supposes himself
viewing several pieces of historic, landskip, and portrait painting; and
from thence takes occasion to represent the figures, prospects, and
passions, which the artist has exhibited. As the poet has touched upon
various topics, he has very properly used many different kinds of
metre.” The review in the <i>Monthly</i> (vol. 39, p.&nbsp;316, in the
monthly catalogue for October), written by John Langhorne, as Professor
Nangle’s <i>Index</i> shows, was less favorable. “There is great variety
in the numbers of this ode; but, in our opinion, they are not combined
in such a manner as to produce a natural or agreeable harmony. There is
sometimes, too, a&nbsp;falling off, not far removed from the Bathos.
Thus, when the Author says his poetical ideas</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Resistless on the rous’d imagination pour,</p>
<p>And paint themselves as lively as before;</p>
</div>

<p>we cannot help feeling the weakness of the latter verse. Yet there is
poetry, there is enthusiasm, there is energy in this piece, on the
whole, though it is not without many defects.” That these reviews
appeared in May and October 1768 is compelling evidence for dating the
pamphlet, in spite of Mr. Griffin, 1768. Walpole once more proves
himself a reliable source. Why the publication was delayed for over a
year will probably remain a mystery.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p>Apart from the few papers relating to him that have survived since
his death in 1778, little more is known of the Rev. Thomas Morrison of
Great Torrington in Devon than the main facts of his life; among those
papers, however, are some letters--written by Sir Joshua Reynolds and
others--about his literary pursuits, in which Dr. Johnson was at one
time briefly concerned.</p>

<p>He was born on March 26, 1705, at Midhurst in Sussex, the elder son
of Thomas Morrison of that place and Sarah Bridges. As to his ancestry,
the family seems to have claimed kinship with the Morrisons of
Cassiobury Park in Hertfordshire. At the age of twelve he was entered as
a scholar upon the foundation at Winchester, where he remained until his
election in 1723 to a probationary fellowship of New College, Oxford;
his admission as a full fellow followed in 1725. Having received his
Bachelor’s degree in 1727, he became M.A. in 1731, took orders, and was
presented to the college living of Steeple Morden in Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>It may also have been in 1731, though possibly earlier, that he went
down into Devon to act as tutor to John Basset of Heanton Court near
Barnstaple--a&nbsp;step which was, as things turned out, to make him a
resident of that county for the rest of his life. His pupil’s father had
died in 1721, leaving a widow, Elizabeth, the only daughter and eventual
heiress of Sir Nicholas Hooper, Sergeant-at-Law. Sir Nicholas, who had
represented Barnstaple in seven successive
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
parliaments and was a man of considerable wealth, died in May, 1731;
almost exactly a year later, in May, 1732, his daughter, then
thirty-seven years of age and described in a letter written at that time
as a lady much admired for her piety, prudence and good conduct, was
married to Thomas Morrison, then twenty-seven. Three children were born
of their marriage: Mary in 1734, Eleanora in 1736, and Hooper in 1737.
In the year following the birth of their son Mrs. Morrison died,
presumably at Bath as she is buried in the Abbey Church of that city; on
the tablet he placed there to her memory her husband said that she had
been the best of wives who, for the few years she lived with him, not
only made him a much happier man, but a better man, since not only had
her rational and endearing conversation been the perpetual delight of
his heart, but her exemplary conduct had likewise been the pleasing rule
and constant direction of his life.</p>

<p>Upon his marriage Morrison had necessarily resigned his fellowship of
New College, and two years later he also gave up the college living in
Cambridgeshire; the benefices that he afterwards held were all in the
diocese of Exeter. In 1736 he was made a prebendary of Exeter and became
Rector of Wear Giffard; the following year, after obtaining a
dispensation to hold the two livings together, he was also instituted to
High Bickington, which, however, he resigned in 1742. In 1744 he became
Rector of Littleham, soon afterwards resigning Wear Giffard; and
finally, in 1758, after resigning Littleham in its turn, he was
instituted to Langtree, of which parish he continued Rector until his
death twenty years later. The presentations to these livings were made
as follows: to Wear Giffard by Lord Clinton, Lord Lieutenant of the
county from 1721 to 1733, whose seat was at Castle Hill near Barnstaple;
to High
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
Bickington and to Littleham by John Basset of Heanton--who was patron of
half a dozen livings; to Langtree by John Rolle Walter of Bicton in
South Devon and Stevenstone House near Great Torrington, Member of
Parliament for Exeter.</p>

<p>These parishes all lie within six miles of Great Torrington where
Morrison appears to have been resident from at least as early as 1750.
In his answers to the Bishop’s queries of 1744 he had, however, declared
himself to be resident partly in Huntshaw, a&nbsp;parish adjoining Wear
Giffard; and--for reasons of his health and the education of his
children--partly at Westleigh on the mouth of the Torridge, a&nbsp;few
miles off. In which intervening year he established himself at Great
Torrington is not known.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had made two further marriages: in 1739 to Margaret,
daughter of the Rev. Robert Ham and widow of John Ham of Widhays, who
died in 1744; and in 1745 to Honour, daughter of Sir Thomas Bury and
widow of the Rev. George Bussell, who died at Great Torrington in 1750.
Both these later marriages were childless.</p>

<p>Hooper Morrison followed his father into the Church and became Rector
of Atherington near Barnstaple. In 1769 he bought the property of Yeo
Vale, some five miles from Great Torrington. Eleanora Morrison, who
never married and seems to have lived with her father until his death,
sat to Reynolds in her younger days; the portrait then painted, which
was formerly at Yeo Vale, shows her in profile and wearing a blue velvet
mantle edged with ermine.</p>

<p>There was also among the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘protraits’">portraits</ins> at Yeo Vale a three-quarter length of
an agreeable-looking man, apparently between thirty and forty years of
age, shown wearing a red velvet cap and an unusual coat, like a
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
full-skirted cassock made of blue satin; this portrait, the work of
Hudson, was believed to represent Thomas Morrison.</p>

<p>Coming now to the letters, the earliest of these, written in
February, 1753, is from Morrison to the Bishop of Exeter, Dr. Lavington,
who two years before had published the third part of his book, <i>The
Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists Compared</i>. The letter is
inscribed on the outside “Mr. Morrison’s Ode,” and must have been
returned to its writer after the Bishop’s death in 1762.</p>

<div class = "letter">
<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>Since I had the honour of being with your Lordship in Exeter I have
with great pleasure read over the third part of the Enthusiasm of
Methodists and Papists compar’d, and as by having my Boy at present
under my own Care I have been oblig’d to renew my acquaintance a little
with the Classicks, I&nbsp;have endeavour’d to express my Sentiments of
your Lordship’s learned and acute performance in the following Ode,
which if it should afford you a Quarter of an Hours Amusement will be no
little pleasure to me--that your Lordship may read it with the more
Indulgence think that the Scribbler of it has not attempted to write
Latin verse for above twenty years, and believe me to be with the
Highest Respect,</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<p>There is nothing to show to whom the next letter was written, though,
considering the later ones, it seems likely that it was addressed to
Joshua Reynolds. It concerns a tragedy (on the subject of the Emperor
Otho) of which Morrison was undoubtedly the author. John Beard, on whose
behalf the letter was written in February, 1763, had become manager of
Covent Garden Theatre in the previous year.</p>

<div class = "letter">
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Mr. Beard’s attention to the Affairs of the Theatre having entirely
taken up his Time, during this Season, from which, as yet, he is not
releas’d, deprives him of the Pleasure of writing to you, in Answer to
the Letter you did him the Favour of communicating from the Author of
Otho; he, therefore, hopes you will excuse his deputing me to convey to
you the Opinion of his Friends thereon; and if they differ in Sentiment
with the Author, it is with some Concern, as they wou’d rather give
Approbation to a Piece, which has, indeed, great merit in the Writing,
but will not suit the Taste of an English Audience.</p>

<p>How well, and with what Propriety, a Dramatic Piece may be conducted
wherein are very few Characters, it is not now intended to be entered
upon; but it is very certain, from the Want thereof, many Productions
have fail’d of their expected Applause; of which, very many Instances
might be produc’d; wherein that has been the Chief, if not the only
Defect. The French, indeed, tho’ a Nation of great Levity, can
attentively listen to long declamatory Speeches, when an English
Audience wou’d fall asleep; who love Action and Bus’ness, love Plot and
Design; Variety of Incidents is their Delight, but yet that Plot must be
founded on Reason and Probability, and conduce to the Main Action of the
Drama. It is the Advice of a celebrated Author, <i>Habitum hujus
Temporis habe</i>; the Taste of the Town, you know, Sir, right or wrong,
must be comply’d with; without which, to hope for Success, is striving
against the Stream, and however great the Merit of this Piece may be, it
must be confess’d, in this Particular, it is defective; nor does there
appear a Probability of that Defect’s being corrected; and even then it
wou’d be esteem’d but a Copy of Cato.</p>

<p>From the Author’s great Candour and Impartiality, remarkably shewn
thro’ the whole Tenour of his Letter, it is hop’d a few additional
Remarks will not give Offence. [Here ensues a lengthy passage of
detailed criticism, at the end of which the writer continues:] It wou’d
greatly
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
trespass on yours and the Author’s Time to enlarge on this Subject, as
Mr. Beard cannot give him any Encouragement to make Alterations.
Undoubtedly there are several good Scenes, and much good Writing, which
deserve their proper Encomiums; and the Perusal may give much pleasure
in the Closet, but does not bid fair for equal Reception on the
Stage.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss this without clearing up a mistake which the Author
is run into; tho’ urg’d with the utmost Tenderness and Delicacy
imaginable; I&nbsp;mean the Supposition that a Recommendation from a
Person of Figure in the Fashionable or the Letter’d World is necessary
for the having the Piece accepted. Be assur’d, Sir, every Piece must be
determin’d by its own intrinsic Worth; and by that must stand or fall.
Such a Recommendation undoubtedly wou’d raise the Expectation and,
consequently, engage a more particular Attention of the Manager, but the
Piece must speak for itself; and shou’d it not answer Expectation, might
probably not appear in so good a Light as it might deserve, purely from
the Disappointment.</p>

<p>I have the Honour, Sir, of sending Mr. Beard’s Compliments to
yourself and the Author, with the Assurance that he wou’d with greater
Pleasure accept than refuse the Piece, stood it within the Probability
of Success. At the same Time, tho’ unknown, I&nbsp;beg leave, with great
Deference, to subscribe myself,</p>

<p>There now follow the three surviving letters from Joshua Reynolds in
London to Thomas Morrison in Devon. Whether or not the two men had known
each other before, they certainly met when Reynolds visited his sister,
Mrs. Palmer of Great Torrington, during his Journey into the west
country with Johnson in 1762. According to Reynolds’ engagement book,
Morrison was his host on August 27 of that year; while a letter written
by Johnson, after returning to London, contains a message for “Dr.
Morison” to say that a set of <i>Idlers</i> was being sent to him with
sincere acknowledgements of all his civilities. The first of Reynolds’
letters is dated, at the end, August 16, 1766.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<div class = "letter">
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The greatest compliment I have ever yet receiv’d for any fancied
eminence in my profession has not been so flattering to my vanity as
having had the honour to have so excellent a Poem address’d to me as
this really is which I have now before me, and the consideration that
this compliment is made me by Mr. Morrison makes me at a loss in what
manner to express the obligation I feel myself under for so great a
favour. I&nbsp;may truly say and without affecting much modesty that I
am not worthy of the attention you please to honour me with.</p>

<p>As I have not had time yet to consider it as maturely as I intend to
do, I&nbsp;can only say in general terms that I admire it
exceedingly.</p>
</div>

<p>Here there is a break in the letter.</p>

<div class = "letter">
<p>I am quite ashamed to have kept this Letter so long, which proceeded
from an expectation I dayly had of reading the Poem with Mr. Johnson and
Dr. Goldsmith but which I have not yet been able to accomplish.</p>

<p>The former part of this Letter was wrote a few days after I had the
pleasure of seeing your Son; you have surely the greatest reason in the
world to think me the most ill mannered as well as the most ungrateful
person breathing in not returning my thanks sooner; and now that it is
delay’d so long it has not answerd any end except that I have the
pleasure of saying, I&nbsp;find no cause on a second and third reading
to retract what I said in the former part of the Letter, my own opinion
is worth but little; but I hope soon to have the pleasure of acquainting
you with the approbation of those Critics which it is some honour to
please.</p>

<p>With great acknowledgment for the distinction you have been pleased
to honour me with,</p>

<p>I beg my compliments to Miss and Mr. Morrison.</p>
</div>

<p>To this Morrison evidently sent a reply expressing his pleasure at
Reynolds’ praise of the poem, for on January 8, 1767, Reynolds wrote
again.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<div class = "letter">
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for the compliment you make me in thinking
my approbation of any value, to tell you the truth the reason of my
setting so little value on it myself, proceeds not so much from modesty,
or an opinion that I cannot feel the powers of Poetry, or distinguish
beauties from defects, but from a consciousness that I am unable to
determine (as all excellence in comparative) what rank it ought to hold
in the scale of Art; and this judgement can be possess’d I think by
those only who are acquainted with what the world has produced of that
kind.</p>

<p>I have lately had the pleasure of reading your Poem to several
friends, who have spoken much in its commendation, and Mr. Johnson who
is as severe a Critic as old Dennis approves of it very much, he thinks
it superior to any Poem of the kind that has been publish’d these many
years and will venture to lay a wager that there is not a better
publish’d this year or the next.</p>

<p>The Characters of the several Masters mention’d in the Poem are truly
drawn; and the descriptions of the several kinds of History Painting
shew great imagination and a thorough knowledge of the Theory of the
Art, and that this is deliver’d in Poetry much above the common standard
I have Mr. Johnson’s word who concluded his commendation with Imprimatur
meo periculo which order if you have no objection we will immediately
put in execution.</p>

<p>There is no record of any copy of the poem, either printed or
manuscript, having been at Yeo Vale; but that the order had indeed been
put in execution became apparent lately when Professor Hilles, on
reading the above letter, recognized the identity of Morrison’s poem
with the <i>Pindarick Ode on Painting</i> published in 1767.</p>

<p>The last of the three letters from Reynolds to Morrison is dated
March 2, 1771. Notwithstanding the rejection of “Otho,” its author had
written a second tragedy, the manuscript of which was among the
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
papers at Yeo Vale, according to a note made in 1917 by the late Major
J.&nbsp;H. Morrison Kirkwood.</p>

<div class = "letter">
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Nothing would give me greater uneasiness [than] if you should suspect
that my not answering your Letter proceeded from neglect, it would be a
shamefull return for the kindness I have allways experienced from you,
the truth is Mr. Coleman [sic] as well as myself is allways so full of
business that I have not been able to meet with him so often as I could
wish, however when we do meet I have endeavourd to press him to complete
the negociation by Letter as I found it impossible to persuade you to
come to Town. The last time I saw him he told me he would write to you
in a few days, as by this time you have probably receiv’d his Letter,
you have a more explicit account than any I can give. In regard to the
hundred Pounds for which I told him you would let him have the Tragedy,
he said he fear’d that you suspected that he wanted to decline receiving
it, which was not the case, that he wish’d to receive it and certainly
would when those alterations were made, that if he gave this sum for the
Tragedy, he should probably receive more profit from it than he had any
right to, that he never would receive any profit but as Manager.</p>

<p>On reading this, Morrison may well have thought that his tragedy was
almost certain of acceptance; a&nbsp;few months later, however, he heard
from George Colman, who had succeeded Beard as manager of Covent Garden
Theatre in 1767. The letter is dated July 23, 1771, and its opening
sentence is explained by the death of Colman’s wife earlier in the
year.</p>

<div class = "letter">
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>My last Letter would very soon have been succeeded by another if a
very unexpected &amp; most shocking domestick calamity had not rendered
me wholly incapable of attending to every kind of business. I&nbsp;have
however lately read your Tragedy over &amp; over with the strictest
attention, and after considering it again &amp; again, not without a
real
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
partiality to the Author, &amp; the strongest desire of encouraging the
most favourable idea of it, I&nbsp;am with much concern obliged to
declare it unfit for representation.</p>

<p>The first act is very excellent, &amp; with a few slight alterations,
would be a most affecting opening of a Tragedy. In the second act the
scene of Iphigenia is also extremely beautiful and interesting; but the
other parts of the act have no dramatick merit. The circumstance so much
insisted on of Clytemnestra’s dressing (tho’ I&nbsp;believe in
Euripides) wd. appear ridiculous on our stage: and the scenes of Memnon
and Achilles are weak &amp; illwritten, tho’ the entrance of Achilles at
that juncture might afford a spirited &amp; interesting scene.</p>

<p>In these acts, as well as the two following, the conduct of the fable
is in general just: at least it is most wonderfully improved since your
first draught of the Tragedy: and yet the characters &amp; dialogue are
so managed as to render the whole cold, uninteresting, &amp; totally
destitute of that spirit essential to the success of the Drama. The
personages are all suffered to languish, tho’ in situations which
require the utmost animation &amp; force. Clytemnestra &amp; Iphigenia,
though defective, are indeed better sustained than the rest, but the
consequence of the Atridae hardly survives the first act, and Achilles
never maintains any consequence at all.</p>

<p>The same remark may in general be applied to the fifth act as to the
foregoing. The management of the catastrophe might perhaps admit of
alteration. The nature of the subject indeed renders it a very nice
point: tho’ I think it would be very possible to give it due warmth
&amp; interest, were the more arduous task accomplished of perfecting
the preceding parts of the Drama.</p>

<p>Believe me, Sir, that in this as well as in all my other Letters to
you, I&nbsp;have delivered my real sentiments, tho’ it is not without
reluctance &amp; regret on the present occasion. I&nbsp;had at first
some objections to the subject. These vanished; &amp; in the first
draught there were here &amp; there some touches which inclined me to
hope that the whole piece might be worked up by the same hand. I&nbsp;am
sorry to pronounce it has failed: but <i>Ponere Totum</i> is the great
secret; and in our exhibitions a common Dauber, possest of that happy
knack, will often be attended with tolerable success, and exult at the
failure of a superior artist who has only laboured particular parts.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class = "right">
G. Colman.</p>

<p>This letter, which must have left its recipient without further hope
for the production of his tragedy, is the last that remains.</p>

<p>Thomas Morrison died on July 20, 1778, and was buried beside his
third wife in the churchyard at Great Torrington. The inscription on the
tablet placed to his memory in the church nearby says of him that his
diffusive charity and benevolence towards man, his amiable manners, the
goodness of his heart and his exemplary conduct deservedly endeared him
to all his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Hooper Morrison died in 1798; his only son, Thomas Hooper Morrison,
in 1824; and his son’s widow in 1861. The Yeo Vale property then passed
to his son’s niece, Eleanora Elizabeth Hammett, who was the wife of John
Townsend Kirkwood, great-grandfather of the present writer, and the sole
surviving child of Hooper Morrison’s youngest--but only
married--daughter.</p>

the subject of this Ode is, from the copiousness of it, almost an
inexhaustible one (were I to take notice of all the minuter branches of
this art, in which the several masters have distinguish’d themselves,
such as the painting of fruit, flowers, still-life, game, buildings,
ships, &amp;c.) I&nbsp;have confin’d myself chiefly to the three greater
species of it: namely, History (under which Battle-painting may justly
be included) Landskip and Portraiture----and as, in a composition of
this length, I&nbsp;imagin’d that the perpetual recurrence of the same
measure in such a multiplicity of stanzas would have been rather languid
and fatiguing, I&nbsp;have therefore indulg’d myself in many different
kinds of metre; but, at the same time, have blended them as harmoniously
as I could contrive; by which indulgence I have not only consulted my
own ease, but hope I have likewise, in some degree, consulted the
pleasure of the Reader, by entertaining his ear, at least, with a little
variety of wild music, even if the composition should have no other sort
of merit to recommend&nbsp;it.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
